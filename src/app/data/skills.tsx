        My React projects often incorporate Next.js as a framework, because of its popularity
        and server-side rendering capabilities. I have been using Next since Next 14 was released,
        and I am currently still in the learning process. I have a general understanding of{" "}
        <b>client and server components, routes, the layout page</b>, and I often use Next because
        I like Vercel’s Geist font (which can’t be used with any other framework, unfortunately).

        I have about <b className="text-reactBlue">1 year of experience with React</b> for personal
        use. I have built my best projects using React, because of its front-end heavy focus, ease
        of use, and how organised it is. I have so far covered basic topics such as{" "}

          JSX, ternary operators (especially for conditional JSX rendering and styling), states and
          effects

        Tailwind is one of my absolute favourite technologies to use in my web apps, because of how
        easy it is to learn and use. It also comes as a default package installed with many major
        React frameworks, which is helpful for me as I tend to use frameworks far more than vanilla
        JavaScript. I have an understanding of{" "}
        <b className="text-tailwindBlue">adding custom configurations to tailwind.config,</b> and{" "}
        <b className="text-tailwindBlue">I have memorised a good amount of the most popular utility classes</b>{" "}
        (with my <b className="text-tailwindBlue">favourite CSS tool being flexbox</b>). I am hoping
