    "guitar":"I have been playing guitar since I was quite young, and have still not grown old of it. I have achived Rockschool grade 3 in electric guitar and grade 5 in acoustic. I mainly enjoy metal music and electric guitar, but I can play some songs on acoustic too when needed. ",
    "fitness":"Weightlifting has become somewhat of a habit for me, and I have been going consistently to the gym for around a year. I am motivated by any progress I see, and keeping my diet clean day after day provides a sense of accomplishment that I live by.",
    "hiking":"I have done most of my hiking as part of my scout group, which then led me to do the Ten Tors challenge 3 times, where teams of 6 hike across dartmoor at various distances in 2 days unaided. I have completed 35 and 45 miles, and have attempted 55 miles. This event is what has taught me most about teamwork, where we would each have responsibilities such as navigation and setting up camp throughout the day, but also responsibility for ourselves by keeping hydrated and coming prepared for the ever-changing hostile weather patterns.",
    "fashion":"I believe outer appearance is a good indicator of internal state, so for me keeping polished is important, and helps me to work better when I feel more confident. However managing student loans also means I have less options when it comes to clothing, so I often have to be creative and improvise with what I have available to make a good outfit."
